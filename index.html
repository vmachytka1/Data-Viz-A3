			<h2>Overarching Question</h2>
			<p>
				I would like to answer the following quesiton: How has the population
				distribution at the tails (i.e. very young, defined as 0-4 years, and very
				old, defined as 85+ years) evolved from 1900 to 2000, and what are the
				differences in these changes between genders?
			</p>

			<p>
				My understanding is that significant advancements in public health
				and medical care impacted life expectancy and mortality rates. I would
				expect high infant mortality rates and relatively short life expectancies
				due to infectious diseases in the early 1900s. With improvements in sanitation
				and vaccines, more individuals reached advanced age. As a result, by
				the year 2000, a larger proportion of the population was able to live
				into their 80s and beyond. I would also be curious to observe how
				societal shifts have impacted family sizes and measure what proportion
				of the population consists of young individuals in 2000 vs in 1900. I am
				guessing that these trends will likely manifest differently across
				genders, especially given the differences in health outcomes and life
				expectancy between males and females. My goal for this exercise will be
				to visualize these shifts to better understand the reshaped distribution
				of age and gender structure of the American population.

			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="Sketch1.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					A radial visualization showing the proportional changes in age and
					gender from 1900 to 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1: For my first sketch, I decided to utilize a
				radial chart to depict the age groups in 1900 and 2000, allowing for a
				side-by-side comparison of the distributions. Each segment’s length
				corresponds to the population size of the respective age group and the
				color signifies the gender ratio within it. This way, we can directly
				compare how have age and gender distributions shifted over the last 100
				years. This method will allow me to see the varying proportions of gender
				and how these have shifted over time. Moreover, I made the artistic
				choice to utilize the radial format to symbolize the lifecycle.

					showing demographic changes across a century.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2: In my second sketch, I chose the
				stick-figure representations to humanize the data and to provide a
				more tangible sense of the population scale. Each figure corresponds
				to a specific number of individuals of a specific gender, and their
				placement on the age group axis allows for an easy comparison of growth
				and decline. Unlike the radial chart, which emphasized the proportion
				of gender within each age group, this visualization highlights the
				absolute population numbers by gender. I chose this style of visualization
				for its ability to communicate quantitative information and raw numbers easily.

				<img src="Sketch3.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Stacked bars illustrating the growth and decline within each age
					group between 1900 and 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3: For my third sketch, the two stacked bar
				charts connect the age groups from 1900 to 2000 and illustrate the growth
				or decrease of each demographic group. The use of lines with varying
				thickness indicates the magnitude of change and I selected a color
				for each group for easier comparison. I selected this visualization
				because it will emphasize the dynamic shifts between groups and what
				proportion of the population they contain.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Each sketch highlights different insights: the radial chart captures 
		the distribution of ages and the proportional changes of age and gender 
		within it, the stick figures convey the absolute changes in population, 
		and the stacked bar illustrates the demographic shift between individual 
		age groups. However, a notable limitation across all sketches was the binary 
		representation of gender. In future iterations of this project, a more inclusive 
		approach could involve a reimagined way of classifying our data that 
		acknowledges non-binary and other gender identities. This could then 
		add further layers or new graphical elements into our future visualizations 
		that better represent the of gender identities.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="Chart1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					A side-by-side bar chart of age and gender population
					distribution (1900 and 2000). I am exploring the following question:
					How has the population distribution at the tails evolved from 1900
					to 2000, and what are the differences in these changes between genders?

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				I chose to explore the same question as in my sketches above: "How has
				the population
				distribution at the tails evolved from 1900 to 2000, and what are
				the differences in these changes between genders?" To understand
				the distribution of population, specifically the very young (0-4 years)
				and the very old (85+ years) from 1900 to 2000, I designed a
				visualization in Tableau that highlights the shifts in these age
				groups as well as the gender proportions.  
      		</p>

			<p>
				I chose a dual population bar chart, which presents the data in both
				years side by side for direct comparison. My motivation for this
				format was clarity in spotting the relative sizes of total populations,
				as well as by specific age groups. I selected my colors to enhance
				the differentiation between male and female populations and represented
				each age group with stacked bars to easily compare the gender distribution
				within each group. I also made the analytical choice to compute gender
				percentages within each bucket to better understand the demographic shifts. 

			</p>

			<p>
				Through this design, I saw that there has been a significant shift in
				the population distribution at both the younger and older tails from
				1900 to 2000. For the youngest age group, 0-4 years, the chart suggests
				a relative decrease in proportion to the total population by 2000,
				which could be indicative of lower birth rates or smaller family sizes
				as compared to 1900. On the other end of the spectrum, the marked
				increase in the population of those aged 85 and older in 2000
				highlights a substantial rise in life expectancy, likely due to
				advancements in healthcare and overall improvements in quality of
				life. These changes at the tails of the age spectrum underscore the
				demographic transition experienced over the century and reveal
				pivotal shifts in societal structure and health outcomes.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The process of arriving at this final design was inspired by my initial
		sketches from phase one. The radial chart's inspired the emphasis on relative
		size in the final visualization. The stick-figure sketch influenced the decision
		to include absolute population numbers. The third sketch, with its dynamic
		depiction of demographic shifts, contributed to the emphasis on visualizing
		the change over time. Sketching was very valuable for my final design: I was
		able to creatively explore various designs without the constraints of software
		tools. I explored various aspects of the data I normally wouldn’t have, such
		as the contrast in gender distribution across the age groups. The iterative
		process of moving from the sketches to Tableau solidified my understanding
		of the data and helped me refine my storytelling approach.
