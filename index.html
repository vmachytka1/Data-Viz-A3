			<h2>Overarching Question</h2>
			<p>
				I would like to answer the following quesiton: How has the population
				distribution at the tails (i.e. very young, defined as 0-4 years, and very
				old, defined as 85+ years) evolved from 1900 to 2000, and what are the
				differences in these changes between genders?
			</p>

			<p>
				My understanding is that significant advancements in medical care impacted 
				life expectancy and mortality rates. I would
				expect high infant mortality rates and relatively short life expectancies
				due to infectious diseases in the early 1900s. With improvements in public
				health, more individuals reached advanced age over the course of the century. 
				As a result, by
				the year 2000, I am hoping to see that a larger proportion of the
				population was able to live
				into their 80s and beyond. I would also be curious to observe what proportion
				of the population consists of young individuals in 2000 vs in 1900 (as
				societal shifts have impacted family sizes etc). I am
				estimating that these trends will likely manifest differently across
				genders, especially given the differences in health outcomes and life
				expectancy between males and females. My goal for this exercise will be
				to visualize these shifts to better understand the reshaped distribution
				of age and gender.

			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1: My initial vision for Sketch 1 was to 
				better understand the shifts in age distribution, especially at the tails, 
				and explore the gender proportion within these changes. I decided to 
				utilize a radial chart to depict the age groups in 1900 and 2000, 
				allowing for a side-by-side comparison of the two distributions. 
				Additionally, I made the artistic choice to utilize the radial 
				format to explore a new perspective compared to traditional 
				linear graphs and to symbolize the human lifecycle. Each segment’s 
				length corresponds to the population size of the respective age 
				group and the color signifies the gender ratio within it. This way, 
				we can directly compare how have age and gender distributions shifted 
				over the last 100 years. I am expecting to see a broadening of the 
				older age groups as we compare 2000 to 1900 due to improvements in 
				medical care and sanitation. By comparing the two years within the 
				same radial space, I am hoping to visually answer my hypotheses: a 
				decrease in the youngest age bracket due to changing birth rates 
				and a relative increase in the oldest due to rising life expectancies.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2: For my second sketch, I wanted to 
				present my data in a way that allows for immediate understanding. 
				I selected the stick-figure visual to add a more human aspect to the 
				numbers. Each figure represents a group of individuals of specific 
				gender and age group. This way the reader can easily notice the 
				increases and decreases in population across the age spectrum and 
				gender as well as compare the raw number values across the two years. 
				Unlike the radial chart, which emphasized the proportion of gender 
				within each age group, this visualization highlights the absolute 
				population numbers by gender. I chose this type of visualization 
				for its ease of communication, as it makes the complex demographic 
				data more accessible by utilizing a more literal representation of 
				population figures. In my opinion, sketch 2 does a better job at 
				understanding the absolute changes in the population's extremities 
				between the two years. However, it may not as clearly convey how 
				the proportion of each age group relative to the total population 
				has shifted or how the gender ratio within these groups has evolved 
				over time.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3: For my third sketch, I chose to 
				portray my data using two stacked bar charts in order to connect 
				the age groups from 1900 to 2000 and illustrate the growth or decrease 
				of each demographic group. I employed the strategy of varying 
				thickness of the lines connecting the two bars to quantify the degree 
				of change, making it easier to spot which age groups have seen the 
				most significant shifts. Colors are applied to differentiate between 
				the age groups quickly and efficiently. I decided to explore this 
				design to understand how certain age demographics have evolved and 
				how each segment of the population has contributed to the overall 
				population in those two years. Compared to the absolute number focus 
				of the second sketch, this one does a better job at quantifying 
				proportional shifts. However, it may not convey the proportional 
				gender distribution changes within those age groups as sketch one 
				and upon further reflection I would consider splitting this chart 
				into two — one for each gender.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Each sketch highlights different insights that can be drawn from the data: 
		the radial chart captures the distribution of ages and the proportional 
		changes of age and gender within it, the stick figures convey the absolute 
		changes in population, and the stacked bar illustrates the demographic shift 
		between individual age groups. However, a notable limitation across all 
		sketches was the binary representation of gender. In future iterations of 
		this project, a more inclusive approach could involve a different way of 
		classifying our data that acknowledges non-binary and other gender identities. 
		This could then add further layers or new graphical elements into our 
		future visualizations that better represent these gender identities.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				I chose to explore the same question: "How has the population distribution at the tails evolved from 1900 to 2000, and what are the differences in these changes between genders?" To understand the distribution of population, specifically the very young (0-4 years) and the very old (85+ years) from 1900 to 2000, I designed a visualization in Tableau that highlights the shifts in these age groups as well as the gender proportions.  
      		</p>

			<p>
				I chose a dual population bar chart, which presents the data in both years side by side for direct comparison. My motivation for this format was clarity in spotting the relative sizes of total populations, as well as by specific age groups. I selected my colors to enhance the differentiation between male and female populations and represented each age group with stacked bars to easily compare the gender distribution within each group. I sorted the data from oldest to youngest age groups to allow for an intuitive comparison across the buckets and highlight the significant shifts at both ends. I also made the analytical choice to compute gender percentages within each bucket to better understand the demographic shifts within each age group between the two years. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Through this design, I saw that there has been a significant shift in the population distribution at both the younger and older tails from 1900 to 2000. For the youngest age group, 0-4 years, the chart suggests a relative decrease in proportion to the total population by 2000, which could be indicative of lower birth rates or smaller family sizes as compared to 1900. On the other end of my chart I immediately spotted the increase in the population of those aged 85 and older in 2000, which highlights a significant rise in life expectancy (likely due to advancements in healthcare or overall improvements in quality of life). These changes at the tails of the age groups underscore the demographic transition experienced over the century and help us better understand the shifts in societal structures and health outcomes.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

	  <p>
		Similar to the initial sketches, the final visualization also has the limitation
		of representing gender with a binary framework and fails to capture the full
		spectrum of gender identities we have discussed in class. This prohibits us 
		to fully understand the demographic shifts through a more accurate 
		lens. Addressing this limitation in future data 
		collection will be crucial for producing visualizations that more accurately 
		represent poeple's identities.
	  </p>

      <p>
        The process of arriving at this final design was inspired by my initial sketches from phase one. The radial chart inspired me to emphasize the relative sizes and use a side-by-side chart in the final visualization. The stick-figure sketch influenced the decision to include absolute population numbers to better understand the vast differences in raw numbers. The third sketch contributed to the emphasis on visualizing the change over time due to its depiction of demographic shifts. Overall, sketching was very valuable for my final design: I was able to creatively explore various designs without the constraints of software tools. I explored various aspects of the data I normally wouldn’t have, such as the contrast in gender distribution across the age groups. The iterative process of moving from the sketches to Tableau solidified my understanding of the data and helped me refine my storytelling approach. I will definitely approach my next project with a similar mindset, recognizing sketching as a powerful first step in the visualization process.
