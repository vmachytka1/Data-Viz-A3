			<h2>Overarching Question</h2>
			<p>
				I would like to answer the following quesiton: How has the population
				distribution at the extremities (very young, defined as 0-4 years, and very
				old, defined as 85+ years) evolved from 1900 to 2000, and what are the
				differences in these changes between genders?
			</p>

			<p>
				My understanding is that significant advancements in public health
				and medical care impacted life expectancy and mortality rates. I would
				expect high infant mortality rates and relatively short life expectancies
				due to infectious diseases in the early 1900s. With improvements in sanitation
				and vaccines, more individuals reached advanced age. As a result, by
				the year 2000, a larger proportion of the population was able to live
				into their 80s and beyond. I would also be curious to observe how
				societal shifts have impacted family sizes and measure what proportion
				of the population consists of young individuals in 2000 vs in 1900. I am
				guessing that these trends will likely manifest differently across
				genders, especially given the differences in health outcomes and life
				expectancy between males and females. My goal for this exercise will be
				to visualize these shifts to better understand the reshaped distribution
				of age and gender structure of the American population.
