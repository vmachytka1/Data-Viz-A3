			<h2>Overarching Question</h2>
			<p>
				I would like to answer the following quesiton: How has the population
				distribution at the extremities (very young, defined as 0-4 years, and very
				old, defined as 85+ years) evolved from 1900 to 2000, and what are the
				differences in these changes between genders?
			</p>

			<p>
				My understanding is that significant advancements in public health
				and medical care impacted life expectancy and mortality rates. I would
				expect high infant mortality rates and relatively short life expectancies
				due to infectious diseases in the early 1900s. With improvements in sanitation
				and vaccines, more individuals reached advanced age. As a result, by
				the year 2000, a larger proportion of the population was able to live
				into their 80s and beyond. I would also be curious to observe how
				societal shifts have impacted family sizes and measure what proportion
				of the population consists of young individuals in 2000 vs in 1900. I am
				guessing that these trends will likely manifest differently across
				genders, especially given the differences in health outcomes and life
				expectancy between males and females. My goal for this exercise will be
				to visualize these shifts to better understand the reshaped distribution
				of age and gender structure of the American population.

			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1: For my first sketch, I decided to utilize a
				radial chart to depict the age groups in 1900 and 2000, allowing for a
				side-by-side comparison of the distributions. Each segment’s length
				corresponds to the population size of the respective age group and the
				color signifies the gender ratio within it. This way, we can directly
				compare how have age and gender distributions shifted over the last 100
				years. This method will allow me to see the varying proportions of gender
				and how these have shifted over time. Moreover, I made the artistic
				choice to utilize the radial format to symbolize the lifecycle.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2: In my second sketch, I chose the
				stick-figure representations to humanize the data and to provide a
				more tangible sense of the population scale. Each figure corresponds
				to a specific number of individuals of a specific gender, and their
				placement on the age group axis allows for an easy comparison of growth
				and decline. Unlike the radial chart, which emphasized the proportion
				of gender within each age group, this visualization highlights the
				absolute population numbers by gender. I chose this style of visualization
				for its ability to communicate quantitative information and raw numbers easily.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3: For my third sketch, the two stacked bar
				charts connect the age groups from 1900 to 2000 and illustrate the growth
				or decrease of each demographic group. The use of lines with varying
				thickness indicates the magnitude of change and I selected a color
				for each group for easier comparison. I selected this visualization
				because it will emphasize the dynamic shifts between groups and what
				proportion of the population they contain.
